Just stumbled out of the theater, and wow, what a ride. You're Cordially Invited was an emotional buffet, if buffets were sometimes a little stale and occasionally undercooked. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was a feast for the senses, but boy did it leave me a bit exhausted. Maybe that's just me being dramatic but I am kinda tired right now, so whatever.

First things first, the   starts off like it’s trying to charm your socks off with this elaborate wedding invitation scene. 'Cause why not? Who doesn’t love a borderline ridiculous font choice paired with violins. But then, suddenly, BAM! We’re hitting existential crisis 𝘮𝘰𝘥e faster than I can say blah blah vows. It goes deep. Like, questioning-life-at-3-AM deep. 

The characters? Mixed bag. Lars, the best man, is every bit the perfect disaster you'd expect — stumbling around like he’s forgotten how to human. Meanwhile, the bride’s friend, whose name I cannot for the life of me remember, was a masterclass in side-eyes and strategically timed sighs. I think I sardonically cheered for her at one point. Socially inappropriate? Meh, maybe.

> Speaking of inappropriate, what was with that goat?! Seriously! It’s like they thought, let’s throw a farm animal into this emotional cocktail for a good laugh. Of course, the goat was a plot device or metaphor or...some artsy mumbo-jumbo that went over my head while I was still laughing about it trying to eat the church flowers.

The whole plot is like a jigsaw puzzle, and I’m pretty sure someone lost a piece under the couch. But I’m okay with it because not everything needs to make sense, right? The art of confusion or whatever. You almost want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause every five minutes and catch those micro-expressions that were probably super intentional or just accidental, idk.

let’s get the groom_out = function(chaosLevel) {
    return chaosLevel > 9000 ? he's outta there! : still here, sweating bullets;
}

As the credits rolled, I felt like I’d just run a marathon dressed in a tuxedo — sweaty, slightly mental, and still questioning my life choices. But that’s the beauty, I guess. Who wouldn’t wanna feel punch-drunk and introspective at 10 PM on a Tuesday night? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , don’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, whatever floats your existential boat. If you do, bring tissues and maybe a judge-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 friend. Or a goat, if you're into that.
